# Base presentation #

This presentation is backed by a [Py-YYC repository](https://github.com/py-yyc/base-presentation) that has been forked from the [Hekyll repository](https://github.com/bmcmurray/hekyll). Fork from this repository to make a Py-YYC themed presentation.

# Py-YYC volunteers needed! #

To anyone with CSS-chops:
